Smarty 3.2 Notes
================

Enhancements
------------

    $cache_modified_check
Befor 3.2 the brower cache was not used with cached subtemplates which did have individual cache_lifetime.
Smarty 3.2 does now also check the update time of each cached subtemplate. 


Default settings
----------------

    $merge_compiled_include
For maximum redering speed this option is enabled now by default.
Because of this you will no longer see compiled template files in $compile_dir as the compiled code
is merged into the compiled main templates.
