    =====================================================
    A template engine for PHP5
    
Thank you for downloading OPT 2.0.6, a modern template engine for PHP5.
In this document you will find important information about this package.

PACKAGE CONTENTS
================

The package contains a part of Open Power Libs family:
 - Open Power Template - a template engine for PHP5.
 - Open Power Libs core - the files necessary to run everything.
 
Moreover, you will find here the English programmer's manual and
the unit tests.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

The documentation can be found in the /docs directory. It is splitted
in two parts:
 - Opl - describes the OPL core
 - Opt - describes the OPT library

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

The recommended version to run OPL is PHP 5.3, however - the library
does also work on PHP 5.2. 

INSTALLATION
============

In order to install the library, copy the /lib directory into your
project directory tree. The initialization can be done by loading
`/lib/Opl/Base.php` file manually and configuring the autoloader:

~~~~
[php]
<?php
require('./lib/Opl/Base.php');
Opl_Loader::setDirectory('./lib/');
Opl_Loader::register();
   
// Now you can use OPL and OPT
~~~~

If your webserver supports PHP 5.3, you may also download official PHAR-s
from [Invenzzia Website](http://www.invenzzia.org):

~~~~
[php]
<?php
require('./opl.phar');
require('./opt.phar');
   
// Now you can use OPL and OPT
~~~~

Please note that the PHAR-s do not contain any extra stuff, like
documentations, unit tests etc. - they are just plain libraries.

USAGE
=====

The examples can be found in the `/examples` directory. We also
recommend to read the user manual and the tutorials published on
http://www.invenzzia.org/

VERSION INFORMATION
===================

This is a stable version of Open Power Template 2. We believe that
it is stable enough to be used in the production environment.

UNIT TESTS
==========

In order to execute the unit tests, you must have the PHPUnit utility.
You can install the package using the PEAR installer. Execute the
following commands in the console:

$ pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
$ pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

Now you can switch into the tests/Opx/ directory and execute some tests
with:

$ phpunit testname

Before running test, make sure that the library paths in "tests/paths.ini"
file are set correctly.
